						<h4><b>Reiki</b></h4>
						<p class="text-justify">Reiki (pronounced “ray key”) is one of the more widely known forms of energy healing and is considered a complete system of holistic healing and personal development.  It is an ancient practice using Universal Life Force Energy (or God-Directed energy) for self-healing, healing or relaxing others, developing higher consciousness, and fulfilling a spiritual purpose. </p>
						
						<p class="text-justify">Reiki is an ancient and profoundly simple “laying-on-of-hands” healing art which can have remarkable healing effects.  The word Reiki is a combination of two Japanese words ~ rei, which means spiritual, universal spirit, or sacred; and ki, which means energy. </p>
						
						<p class="text-justify">The best defense against disease of any kind is to achieve and maintain a sense of well-being, which Reiki provides for us.  When there is a lack of love from self or others, there is a feeling of separateness, a sense of loss that penetrates all levels of being.  By allowing Reiki to flow through, the practitioner helps others on all levels to experience this integration, this love.</p>
						
						<p class="text-justify">The simple act of placing hands on the human or animal body to comfort and relieve pain is as old as human kind itself.  The living body radiates warmth and energy.  This energy is the Universal Life Force, which is Reiki, which is Love.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-left">In the West Reiki is most often described as Universal Life Force Energy ~ an unseen force that gives us life and flows through us.  Furthermore, it is believed that when this Life Force Energy is low or depleted, we are more likely to suffer stress and dis-ease.  When it is high, we are more likely to be joyful and healthy.  A treatment may feel like a warm, glowing radiance flowing through and around you.</p>
					
					<p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-right">Reiki healing works on four levels:  the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual.  It grounds the body, expands consciousness, and balances the emotions.  Reiki helps to create equilibrium of energy, which in turn creates a harmonious environment within the human body so true healing can take place.</p>
					
					<p class="text-justify"  data-aos="fade-left">The beauty of Reiki is that it enhances the unique blend of energy around you and within you to form a powerful life force that has the ability to heal not only the physical body but also your mental, emotional and deeper spiritual issues.</p>
					
					<p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-right">Achieve greater balance, evaporate toxic energy from your aura and life force, and restore your wellness through the soothing touch of our Reiki treatments. Experience the healing energy of the Universal Life Force.</p>

						<p class="text-justify">I had a Reiki session administered to me by Isis Iyata which was quite special. Her ability to channel energy for physical and spiritual healing is extraordinary. The experience was both relaxing and restorative. I had been experiencing adrenal fatigue which she was able to determine and treat effectively. I would highly recommend her and her work. She is a gifted energy worker.<br>

						<h4><b>Reiki Attunements</b></h4>
						<p class="text-justify">Although Reiki training involves learning symbols and techniques, the healing ability itself is not taught in the usual sense.  It is transferred to the student by a Reiki Master during an attunement process allowing the student to tap into the unlimited supply of Universal Life Force Energy.</p>
						
						<p class="text-justify">Everyone has the ability to become a Reiki Healer.  The Reiki Master attunes the student gradually to the Reiki energy and reveals symbols of meditation that can be used within the student’s energy field to accomplish higher vibrations of energy.  This meditation is guided though a celestial universal force that guides each student through their individual journey of healing.</p>
						
						<p class="text-justify">Those who become Reiki healers must first learn to become attuned to the Reiki energy allowing their natural healing energies to become enhanced.  You have to learn to recognize the energy forces around your own body before you can appreciate how to send positive energy to others.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row">
					<p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-left">Traditionally, Reiki training is based on traditions handed down for generations and taught in three degrees.  Each degree allows the student to become further attuned to the healing energy.  First degree Reiki is primarily an etheric/physical self-healing energy for the student.  It has a tremendous ability to balance the chakras, remove negative energy from a person’s auric field, relieve stress, and heal the body in general. </p>
					
					<p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-right">Second degree Reiki deals primarily with healing the mental and emotional levels of one’s being.  First degree energy is enhanced and amplified, and one is taught how to send the healing Reiki energy over a distance as well as to other points in time.  Other advanced techniques are taught that can facilitate deep emotional healing, which is often the true cause of disease.</p>
					
					<p class="text-justify"  data-aos="fade-left">Third degree Reiki is the Master/Teacher level and is of a very spiritual nature.  It integrates all levels of one’s being, and, as a result, initiates high self contact.  Master/Teacher training provides one with the ability to attune others and teach Reiki I, II, and III classes.</p>

						<h4><b>Touch Therapy</b></h4>
						<p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-left">Touch is necessary and vital for human development. It has been proven that if we deprive a newborn of social touch, growth is slowed, compulsive rocking and other self-soothing behaviors emerge, and, if not rectified, emergent disorders of mood, cognition, and self-control can persist through adulthood.</p>
						
						<p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-right">In our zeal to protect children from sexual predators, we have promoted no-touch policies for teachers, coaches, and other supervisory adults that have the inadvertent effect of adding to the touch deprivation of our children.  As these kids have grown up in a touch-phobic environment and propagated these fears to their own children, our society as a whole has become further impoverished. </p>

							<h4><b>Why do we need touch once we become adults? </b></h4>
							<p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-left">Interpersonal touch is a crucial form of social glue.  It connects people in the community and in the workplace, fostering emotions of gratitude, sympathy, and trust.  From skin to nerves to brain, our body’s touch circuits are a complex system that powerfully influences our lives, affecting everything from consumer choice and sexual behavior to tool use and chronic pain to the deep origins of language and the process of healing. </p>
							
							<p class="text-justify" data-aos="fade-right">The transcendence of touch resides in the details and those details are in the dedicated nerve fibers in our skin that predispose us to like a soft caress ~  but only if it moves at the proper speed and pressure across the skin.  They are in the brain’s specialized centers for emotional touch.  Activity in these brain regions determines whether a given touch will feel emotionally positive or negative, depending upon the context in which it occurs. </p>
