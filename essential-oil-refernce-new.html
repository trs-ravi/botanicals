                            Neroli is from the flowers & this oil is most closely related to spiritual life. Both
                            sensual & spiritual, helps to re-establish links between a disconnected body & mind.
                            Consider for any deep emotional pain that robs one of hope & joy. Its calming effect on
                            Heart & Mind associate it with Fire Element. Instills comfort & strength, and assists in the
                            release of repressed emotions – through relaxing & reuniting our solar & lunar (conscious &
                            subconscious worlds). Not only calms & soothes the Mind (Shen), but also restores a sense of
                            hope to the Ethereal Soul (Hun).

                            nature & with the Divine. The teaching which Neroli embodies is that sexuality is neither
                            pure nor impure. Sex at its highest form is an expression of our highest self. Neroli
                            reflects the purity of a newborn child.

                            In sexual relations it calms conscious mind; allaying worries over “performance”; smoothing
                            path to mutually satisfying sexual relations (mild aphrodisiac). Relaxing yet arousing, it
                            is associated with purity, reassurance, retrieval, renewal. Symbolizes both seduction &
                            sexual purity. Acts as both an aphrodisiac & a relaxant in times of anxiety related to
                            sexual problems; it will ease communications, enabling partners to reach deeper clarity.
